This repository contains the assignment for the course CSE530 - Distributed Systems. In this course, I have delved into advanced concepts such as gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls) for efficient communication between distributed systems, the Raft consensus algorithm for achieving distributed consensus, and the implementation of MapReduce for parallel processing of large data sets. These implementations demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of distributed computing paradigms and their practical applications.
